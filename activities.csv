Jim passed away this summer in a bicycle crash - the course goes by his house so it was a great way to see family and tribute him. The straw hat had a bit of drag - but his friends from his running club appreciated it. As far as the running - I felt good energy and fitness wise. First 7 I had to focus on slowing down. From 9 on my hamstring locked up - don't know why. Even though I felt good, I could only do 6:50 ish. Hamstring just wouldn't let me go faster.

Settled into 2/3 at the mile mark, and stayed there until the turn around, which is where the errors began.  First, going around the cone - my feet flew out from under me thanks to some loose gravel.  The guy with me was a good sport and waited/helped me up.  However, I couldn't really get it back.  My quad/hip seized up a bit when I fell.  Also, I spilled my water before I got any... which is the start of another string of errors.  The next water stop had some many people going the other way that I missed it.  The following was set up on the wrong side of the road, but went across to get some.  The following wasn't ready so I didn't get any....  basically I got a sip of water from 4-11 and was hurting by the end.

Interesting race, only noticed that there wasn’t clock when I was on the line. As normal, wasnt wearing a watch, so turned to Joe and just told him I was going to trust his pacing.  Since our heat was mostly high-schoolers, we planned on getting to the back assuming they were going to start fast.

At the start the runner in lane 1 fell, so it was stopped and we lined up again.

On the second attempt, we got to the back as planned, but it seemed to go out slow.  So joe started moving up, and I just tried to follow.  The first 800 has lots of contact, I got clipped  almost fell, a few times we had to abruptly slow to avoid getting caught up. Joe later told me we went through 800
In 2:32. 

At 800 joe noticeably increased the pace and I followed with a couple nifty moves to pass on his part.  We took the lead at 1200 and pushed over the last 400 to go 1/2 in the heat.  Joe did all the work/thinking.  I was appreciative to just follow.   Never felt that I was in trouble, but definitely had marathon legs and didn’t have much for a top end gear.",296,1.61,,false,,,0.0,,296.0,296.0,1609.4000244140625,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
